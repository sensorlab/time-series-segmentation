## TSSB
TSSB.ipynb is a notebook that converts time series from the TSSB dataset into graphs. The dataset consists of 75 different time series, each with varying lengths and segments. This notebook transforms the time series into graphs, selects labels based on the segments, and determines which nodes will be used for training and testing by applying masks.   
The TSSB datasets can be acquired from this github repository: [TSSB](https://github.com/ermshaua/time-series-segmentation-benchmark/tree/main/tssb/datasets) 

# How to install and run
TSSB notebook contains cells at the beginning that install the required versions of the packages. The cells, with the exception of pip install, Config, and the last main cell, are functions that must be executed before the last cell is executed, which runs the entire program. To change the parameters, the Config Cell can be edited located before the last cell in each notebook.
